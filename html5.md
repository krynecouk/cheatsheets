## Section elements
### `<body>`
> The body element represents the contents of the document. Only one in document.

### `<article>`
> Represents independent item of content (forum post, magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a user-submitted comment etc.).

```html
<article itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
 <header>
  <h1 itemprop="headline">The Very First Rule of Life</h1>
  <p><time itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2009-10-09">3 days ago</time></p>
  <link itemprop="url" href="?comments=0">
 </header>
 <p>If there's a microphone anywhere near you, assume it's hot and
 sending whatever you're saying to the world. Seriously.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <footer>
  <a itemprop="discussionUrl" href="?comments=1">Show comments...</a>
 </footer>
</article>
```

### `<section>`
> `<div>` with special semantic meaning. Use if block is needed (feels like) that belongs to a table of contents.

> `<article>` element instead of the `<section>` element when it would make sense to syndicate the sections of the article.

```html
<article>
 <hgroup>
  <h1>Apples</h1>
  <h2>Tasty, delicious fruit!</h2>
 </hgroup>
 <p>The apple is the pomaceous fruit of the apple tree.</p>
 <section>
  <h1>Red Delicious</h1>
  <p>These bright red apples are the most common found in many
  supermarkets.</p>
 </section>
 <section>
  <h1>Granny Smith</h1>
  <p>These juicy, green apples make a great filling for
  apple pies.</p>
 </section>
</article>
```

### `<header>` & `<footer>`
> Designed to be used within any part of your document that represents a chunk of content with a clear beginning and end. This can include things like forms, articles, sections of articles, posts on a social media site, cards, etc.

### `<main>`
> The main content area of a document includes content that is unique to that document and excludes content that is repeated across a set of documents (logo, banner, search forms etc.).

> There must not be more than one visible main element in a document. If more than one main element is present in a document, all other instances must have `hidden` attribute.

```html

    <a href="/archive">Archive</a>
</nav>
```

### `<aside>`
> Represents a section of a page that consists of content that is tangentially related to the content around the aside element, and which could be considered separate from that content.

```html
<p>He later joined a large company, continuing on the same work.</p>
<aside>
 <q> People ask me what I do for fun when I'm not at work. But I'm
 paid to do my hobby, so I never know what to answer. </q>
</aside>
...
```

> Single unit separated from main flow with `figcaption`.

 <h1>The reality dysfunction</h1>
 <h2>Space is not the only void</h2>

```

### `<adress>`
